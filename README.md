# Classification-Logistic-Reg-and-Decision-Tree
An in-depth exercise in classification using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, complete with thorough EDA.

An intensive project comparing the results of logistic regression and simple decions trees for a classification problem.  Complete with EDA, pre-processing tasks, and multiple chances to address multicollinearity and p-value assessment to streamline the Log. Reg. model. 
Also ran simple decision trees for comparison.

What I like about these methods (and there are others) is that one can easily assess the impact that different features have on the prediction.  This fact allows you to determine and present relevant solutions and recoomendations to real business problems.  There are other models that could classify faster, and maybe more accurately, ANNs for one, but you would lose the ability to see feature impact.  In order to address the business question, in this case, "How can we predict if a hotel reservation will be cancelled?" requires an ML approach that allows you to identify which features influence the outcome, so they can be addressed.  A simple prediction is far less usefull than a prediction with a key indicators that are easily seen and addressed.
